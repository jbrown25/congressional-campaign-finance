# Untitled Congressional Finance Data project

**Note:** I am rebuilding this project basically from scratch since I'm unhappy with this one.  The front end code is [here](https://github.com/jbrown25/Congressional-Finance-App), and the AWS Lambda function code is [here](https://github.com/jbrown25/congressional-finance-serverless).

Built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/). Data courtesy of the [Center for Responsive Politics](https://www.opensecrets.org/).
